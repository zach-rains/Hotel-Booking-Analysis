## Description:

This project analyzes hotel booking data to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement in revenue management and operational efficiency.

## Data Source:

The dataset used for this analysis contains information on hotel bookings, including booking date, arrival date, lead time, nights, guests, distribution channel, customer type, country, deposit type, average daily rate, status, status update, cancellation status, revenue, and revenue loss.

## Analysis:

Descriptive statistics:
Examining the distribution of lead times.
Calculating the average daily rate and revenue.
Analyzing the cancellation rate.
Trend analysis:
Identifying trends in booking patterns over time.
Investigating the impact of lead time on revenue loss.
Visualization:

Microsoft Excel Dashboard: Used for creating an interactive dashboard to visualize the data.
Key Findings:

Lead Time Impact: Reservations booked with more than one month in advance are causing most of the revenue loss.
Cancellation Rate: The cancellation rate is higher for bookings with longer lead times.
